# Time Tracking 2

## Project Overview

- Personal project aimed to display the focus time for each registered task.

- The theme and tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, so you will have your settings and records saved, even if you close the browser tab.

- Note: If you clear your browser data, you will lose your records.

- The project was developed in a single HTML file using link tags to make it possible to use the style libraries that are being used.

- The script tag is also being used for implementing the JavaScript logic.

- No event is used for time control that remains running after the task is registered. Instead, a comparison is made between the final date and the initial date when the task is finished.

- Next to the tasks, the total time for each defined category will be displayed.
